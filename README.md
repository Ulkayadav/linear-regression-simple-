# linear-regression-simple-
This repository contains a simple implementation of Linear Regression from scratch in Python. The code demonstrates how to compute the optimal weights (coefficients) using the normal equation, without using libraries like scikit-learn.

ðŸ§  What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between one or more features (independent variables) and a continuous target variable (dependent variable). The model has the form:

y=Xw+b
where:

X is the input feature matrix,

w is the vector of weights (coefficients),

b is the bias (intercept),

y is the predicted output.
